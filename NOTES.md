### Notes

- Nothing can be serious if it's not in ~~PowerPoint~~ TypeScript
- CSS/Animation might not be great: I'm not big
  on those, I just tried to make it maintainable
- `patch` is there to fix "images aren't shown in iOS 14" React bug
- Native modules should probably reject instead of returning an empty string
- No error reporting in iOS module
- Tab navigation should probably be inside Stack navigation
- Loading indicators are missing
